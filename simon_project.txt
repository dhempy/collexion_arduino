Behavior
Each button makes a different sound. (same sound each time)

Simon gives you a sound and a light, next to a button.
You have to hit that button.

If you get it right, add another button to the pattern.
Play the pattern again.  The longer the pattern, the faster it plays.
You have to hit the sequence in order.

If you get it wrong, It tazes you.
Then it all starts over. 

Sequence grows until it is 15 notes long.

Advanced mode - activates tazer.
